# Rust_New
Hello Rust

I am new to Rust - this will be an interesting journey.
Heard a lot of good reviews on Rust.

I am previously a system developer on AS400 and would be interested to see how Rust can provide those features that we like in AS400.
I may even have to build them myself, but hopefully there are codes out there.
